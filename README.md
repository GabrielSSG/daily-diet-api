# Daily Diet API

This project is an API for daily diet control, developed as part of Challenge of the **"Creating RESTful APIs with Node.js"** module of the Ignite course by Rocketseat.

## Features

The API has the following features:

- **User Creation:** Allows the creation of a user.
- **User Identification:** Identifies the user between requests.
- **Meal Registration:** Registers meals with name, description, date and time, and whether it is within the diet or not.
- **Meal Editing:** Allows editing of all meal information.
- **Meal Deletion:** Allows deleting a meal.
- **Meal Listing:** Lists all meals of a user.
- **Meal Viewing:** Views the details of a single meal.
- **Metrics Retrieval:** Retrieves user metrics, such as total number of meals, meals within and outside the diet, and best sequence of meals within the diet.

## Business Rules

- Meals must be related to a user.
- The user can only view, edit, and delete the meals they created.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Fastify
- Sqlite (or PostgreSQL in production)
- Knex
- Vitest for testing
- Supertest for API testing
